Computers were made to complete human tasks, it seemed possible, but was harder than expected.

##### Neural networks
- inspired by human biology
- created in the 1950s
- outclassed by Von Neumann Architecture

##### Expert Systems
- Highly complex
- Programmed by hundreds of engineers
- don't work comprehensively

How Children learn
- Expose them to lots of data
- Give them the "correct answer"
- They will pick up the important - patterns on their own

#### The deep learning revolution
- we have lots of data now
	- 90% of the worlds data was generated in the last 18 months
- We have lots of computing power
- We can use the matrix math acceleration of the gpu to do deep learning good
