##### We have been working with combinational circuits.
- Current inputs generate an output. They have no memory of past inputs
- *in discrete math there is combinatorics. or the study of countable things*
- multiplexors
- adders
- g4
- prime
- robot
- etc

#### Sequential circuits:
- consider the current inputs and the history of past events. Thus, this type of circuit has memory

1-bit memory is called a flip-flop 
- flip it on logic 1 and it remembers until you change it
- flop it off to logic-0 and it remembers it
first built them with vacuum tubes then m
n-bit memory is just side-by-side fli
ercury tubes

Then we use transisters haha
