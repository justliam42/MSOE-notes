##### We have been working with combinational circuits.
- Current inputs generate an output. They have no memory of past inputs
- *in discrete math there is combinatorics. or the study of countable things*
- multiplexors
- adders
- g4
- prime
- robot
- etc

#### Sequential circuits:
- consider the current inputs and the history of past events. Thus this type of circuit has memory
