```java
public int countToTen() {
    int ten = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i +=2) {
        ++ten;
    }
    return ten;
}```
The result will not be ten because the incrementor adds two, so by the time i becomes 10, the loop will have only executed 5  times.

The Java code you provided appears to be correct and should work as expected. It defines a method `countToTen` that initializes an integer variable `ten` to 0 and then uses a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to 8 (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 in each iteration). Inside the loop, it increments the `ten` variable by 1 for each iteration. Finally, it returns the value of `ten`, which should be 5 after the loop has executed.

So, the code counts from 0 to 10 by increments of 2 and returns the count, which should be 5.

There is nothing syntactically or logically wrong with the code you've provided.
