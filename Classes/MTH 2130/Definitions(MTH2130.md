- Vector: point with position and magnitude
	- written as <x, y, z>
	- magnitude can be called the length or norm and notated as $\|\overrightarrow{v}\|$
- Initial Point: where the vector originated
- Terminal Point: where the vector ends
- Zero Vector: vector with all zeros
	- <0, 0, 0>
- Unit Vector: vector with magnitude of 1 (doesn't matter direction)
	- Standard unit vectors are notated as i, j, k as vectors in x, y, z directions respectively
- Dot Product: the multiplication of two vectors to become a scalar
