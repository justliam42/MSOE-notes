Standard form canonical : F(abc) = !abc + a!bc ...
Short form canonical: F(abc) = Sigma<sub>m</sub>(3,6,...)

process (with four outputs)
1. make the black box diagram w/ multiple outputs
	- the outputs are labled y<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, etc going up from the bottom...
2. function be like Y(ABC) = ABC+4
	- we finally doing adding?? owo
3. Make truth table
4. make canonical form (maybe short)
	- with multiple oiutputs there are multiple forms
		- Y<sub>3</sub>(ABC) = Sum(4,5,6,7), Y<sub>2</sub>(ABC), ...
	- n-bit input producing an m-bit output
