computer engineering is the moving of energy around to compute

Voltage - named after Volta

- Voltage
    - electrical potential energy
    - unit is volts (V)
    - if we close a switch the voltage increases as it is potential energy
- current
    - dynamic kinetic electrical energy
    - unit: amperes (A)
- switching polarity of voltage changes direction of current

see picture*

- these plots are real valued functions
- infinite number of measurable values
- analog electrical signal
- one way to do numbers is by using voltages representing different numbers (analog)
    - problem with this approach is precision and speed
    - this is analog
    - have to generate between 0-9 volts cleanly without noise and identify the volts (in base ten)
        - or do this with amps which slows down behavior
- so we use 0 or 1 (digital abstraction)
    - binary time woot woot
    - battery with a switch instead of generator with infinite possibilities
    - asking if it is on or off is a very fast ting
    - this is **digital signal**
    - negative volts is off (maybe)
    - off-on, low V-high V, 0-1, false-true
    - This is the **digital abstraction**

we built analog computers for years

binary computers became standard a 1960s
