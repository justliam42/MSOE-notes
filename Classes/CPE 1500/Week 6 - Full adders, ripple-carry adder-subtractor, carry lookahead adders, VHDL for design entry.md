#### Adders (full, ripple, fast)
- addition is the fundamental arithmetic operation
	- we can create subtraction (adding the negative)
	- we can create multiplication (repetitive addition)
	- we can create division (repetitive subtraction)
 - numbers being added together become A and B and carry C
	 - bit slices of the total calculation ?
- when the carry is included in the input, the circuit is a **full adder**, otherwise it is a **half adder**
- Cout is BC + AC + AB
- Sum is canonical, or 3 (2 2 input) XOR gate
