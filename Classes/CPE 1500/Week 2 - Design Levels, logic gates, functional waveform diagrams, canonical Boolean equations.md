transistor level is lower than the gate level.

circuit stack (hierarchy of hardware and shiz):
Software stack
______
System
Functions
Gate Level
Transistor Level

we start with black box diagram (we don't know what the transistors be doing) so like we input A to not gate and it makes not A

Not gate could be called invertor, complementor etc...
