memory 

- first thing we learned to do was use magnetic tape
	- this is slow - has to unwind and wind back up and stuff
	- does not have random access
	- number of bits you can store can be huge though because amt tape can be long
- optical drives and dvd drives could hold more than magnetic hard drives
	- drives are heavy and electronic disks have outpaced them
- a disc spinning pushes air up which changes the head
	- has random access because it just moves to whatever track it needs

- electronic disc
	- by 2010 these were replacing the older tech
	- solid state means no moving parts

- Main memory
	- generally the faster something goes, the more expensive it is.
	- faster than electronic disc and less large
	- working main memory is controlled in size to keep speed fast
	- ram sticks

- Cache memory (hidden memory)
- CPU registers
	- modern cpus have a small number of registers 32 or 64 locations
	- width of the arithmetic circuit, determines the size of these locations (magic number)

Computer screens take alot of bytes,
early computers were text based (with a byte per character)

The industry created many memory types to meet different optimization requirements.
speed
size
power
cost

rom implements a truth table and is non-volatile
the truth table is jus the look-up table 

##### ROM
- mask rom
	- data fixed at factory
- prom
	- programable rom
	- one time programmable by the user
	- basically it blows up fuses to program it
- EPROM
	- erasable prom
	- multi-time programmable, uv erased
	- black electrical tape covers the opening, but degrades over time
- EEPROM
	- electrically erasable prom
	- multi-time programmable, voltage erased
	- e
- FLASH
	- modern high-speed EEPROM


##### RAM
- loses data when powered off (volatile)
- implement also impement a data look-up table
	- address input becomes table input
	- data output becomes table output
- data determines if periodic data refresh is required
- Dynamic ram
	- DDR(number)
