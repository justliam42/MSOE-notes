- byte
	- an 8-bit wide number
	- the only standardized unit of data (ISO 80000)
- nibble
	- commonly used name for a 4-bit number
- least-significant bit
	- the "ones" column
- most-significant bit
	- the z^(n-1) column of an n-bit wide number
- precision
	- the number of values possible in n-bits
- Literal
	- an algebraic variable or its complement
		- A, Ā
- Combinational circuit
	- A circuit in which the outputs depend on the inputs (no memory)
	- Full 3-bit adder is an example
- Sequential circuit
	- A circuit in which the output depends on current and/or previous inputs.
	- RS latch is an example
- Complement 
	- the inverse of a literal...
		- the result is also a literal
